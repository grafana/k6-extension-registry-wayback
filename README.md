# Wayback for k6 Extension Registry

This repository is used to archive the generated k6 Extension Registry.

[Check the history!](https://github.com/grafana/k6-extension-registry-wayback/commits/main/registry.json)

## How it works?

The [registry.json](registry.json) file contains the generated k6 extension registry, which is updated and pushed after every change. Therefore, the [commit history of the registry.json](https://github.com/grafana/k6-extension-registry-wayback/commits/main/registry.json) file is also the history of the k6 extension registry.

In order to make the commit history easier to understand, the commit messages extract the change: which extensions were registered, deregistered, and which properties of the extensions changed.
